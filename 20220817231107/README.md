# My ZettelKasten

The ZettelKasten method is attributed to Niklas Luhmann. Is a file
system that lets you think creatively, and then later organize your
thoughs.

- Notes are directories whose name is the ISO-formatted
  second in GMT/Zulu time, a unique identifier which is simple to
  create (you can do it with a watch).
- Each Zettel directory contains a README.md file in which
  you write the note. Size should be 25 lines of 72 characters each.
- Each Zettel should have a title with header1 `#`.
- Do not link between Zettels. I want the notes to be self-contained as much as possible.
- Do not use hyperlinks. I want the notes to be self-contained as much as possible.
- There should be a README.md in the upmost directory that serves as
  register.
